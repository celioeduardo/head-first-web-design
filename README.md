#Head First - Web Design

##Chapter 1

Need to thinking in navigation twice in the design process:
	1) Think about navigational elements (buttons and nav bars) while working in the overall layout
	
	2) Writing code and building the layout elements as well as linking your pages together

You need to start by organizing your top level navigation. Keep your IA diagram close at hand.


###DETERMINE YOUR TOP LEVEL NAVIGATION

###SKETCHES KEEP THE FOCUS ON FUNCTIONALITY
Draw at least three more concepts on your own sheets of paper.

###CODE THE PROTOTYPE

###SCANNABILITY
Instead of reading your content from left to right, beginning to end, like a book, users scan the text for keywords and concepts—to give them an idea about the contents of the page. 

####Scannability Checklist
* You don’t have to use them all, just the ones that work for your content.
* Clearly written headers
* Small(ish) paragraphs
* Use bold and italics to emphasize important words or phrases.
* Use lists (ordered or unordered) for appropriate content.

###The process you followed in this chapter
* **Pre-production** using Information Architecture and storyboards to build a blueprint for your site so that you’re as efficient and focused as possible when you go digital.
* **Navigation** is based on your IA diagram. It’s more than just linking pages together. Navigation helps your users find information.
* **Layout** uses HTML and CSS to build the site’s interface (which you already came up with on paper back in the pre-production phase).
* **Writing** “fills” the design up with the scannable content that your visitors come to the site for.

###BULLET POINTS
* When you design sites, you should practice user-centered design—creating sites that focus on meeting the needs of your users.
* A design process helps you structure a project so that you stay on task and get things done in an efficient manner.
* Most, if not all, web design projects have 4 components: pre-production, layout, navigation, and writing.
Information Architecture is the process by which your website’s content is broken into chunks and then organized hierarchically in relation to one another.
* Developing your site’s IA is a two step process: organizing your site’s information, and building an IA diagram.
* An IA diagram visually represents the hierarchical organization of sections and subsections of information in your site.
* Top level navigation usually links to those sections in your information architecture one tier below your home/main page.
* The design of your top level navigation depends on the overall design and layout.
* There are a handful of great models for designing top level navigation: horizontal tabs, horizontal buttons, vertical menu, vertical tabs.
* Storyboards are used to visualize your design and test basic layout concepts before you jump into code.
Storyboards are a great way to catch potential design problems before you spend time coding your site.
* Writing for the web is different than writing for print.
* Web users scan webpages instead of reading them from beginning to end.
* Web content needs to be written so that it’s scannable.


##Chapter 2

**Visual Metaphor** can range from subtle (using colors that give the user an abstract feeling that the designer wants to associate with the site’s theme) to direct (using graphics that tie right into the site’s name or identity–like using graphics of rocket ships for a site called Rocket Ship Designs).

**Theme** is your site’s purpose and content. So, the theme of amazon.com is an online merchant that focuses mostly on books. The visual metaphor uses design elements (color, graphics, typography, etc.) that reinforce the site’s theme.

###BULLET POINTS
* When you pre-produce a site, you are able to try out design ideas on paper–thereby avoiding potential mistakes in coding which could cost time, effort, and possibly money.
* A visual metaphor leverages visual elements (images, icons, colors, or fonts) in order to unconsciously reinforce the site’s subject matter.
* When applying a visual metaphor to your site, be subtle and don’t overdo it.
* Storyboards are hand drawn concept art storyboards that are used to visualize your design as a complete entity.
