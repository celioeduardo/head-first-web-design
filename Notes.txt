Need to thinking in navigation twice in the design process:
	1) Think about navigational elements (buttons and nav bars) while working in the overall layout
	
	2) Writing code and building the layout elements as well as linking your pages together

You need to start by organizing your top level navigation. Keep your IA diagram close at hand.
