Need to thinking in navigation twice in the design process:
	1) Think about navigational elements (buttons and nav bars) while working in the overall layout
	
	2) Writing code and building the layout elements as well as linking your pages together

You need to start by organizing your top level navigation. Keep your IA diagram close at hand.


DETERMINE YOUR TOP LEVEL NAVIGATION

SKETCHES KEEP THE FOCUS ON FUNCTIONALITY
	Draw at least three more concepts on your own sheets of paper.

CODE THE PROTOTYPE

SCANNABILITY
Instead of reading your content from left to right, beginning to end, like a book, users scan the text for keywords and concepts—to give them an idea about the contents of the page. 

Scannability Checklist
You don’t have to use them all, just the ones that work for your content.

Clearly written headers

Small(ish) paragraphs

Use bold and italics to emphasize important words or phrases.

Use lists (ordered or unordered) for appropriate content.
